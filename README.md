# Digital Clock
- In today's world, digital clocks are everywhere, from our phones to our microwaves. They're convenient, accurate, and easy to read. But have you ever wondered how they work? Well, it turns out they rely on something called a real-time clock (RTC) integrated circuit, which is like a tiny brain that keeps track of time. 
- In this project, we're going to explore how to use an RTC IC to build our own digital clock. Instead of using fancy displays, we'll keep it simple with a basic LCD screen, like the ones you see on calculators. This way, we can show the time in a clear and easy-to-read format.
